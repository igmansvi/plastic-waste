                    <p class="heading">Plastic Waste</p>
                    <p>Plastic waste, or plastic pollution, is ‘the accumulation of plastic objects (e.g.: plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth’s environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans.</p>
                    <p>It also refers to the significant amount of plastic that isn’t recycled and ends up in landfill or, in the developing world, thrown into unregulated dump sites. In the UK, for example, over 5 million tonnes of plastic is consumed each year — and yet only 1 quarter of it is recycled.</p>

                                    <p>Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that use polymers as a main ingredient.</p><br>

                            <p id="ques">But how it is harmful?</p>
                            <p id="ans"> Plastic sticks around in the environment for ages, threatening wildlife and spreading toxins. Plastic also contributes to global warming. Almost all plastics are made from chemicals that come from the production of planet-warming fuels (gas, oil and even coal).</p><br>
                            <p id="ques">Now! What is plastic waste?</p>
                            <p id="ans">Plastic Waste is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris.</p>
                            <p id="ques">What are the types effecting earth the most?</p>
                            <p id="ques">How can we reduce this plastic usage?</p>
                            <p id="ques">Why should we care about Plastic Waste?</p>
                            <p id="ans">There are many questions arises with this huge consumption of plastic.<br>
                                We are producing 380 millions tons of plastic every year and some reports indicates about more than 50% of that plastic is for 
                                single use purpose only! But for our planet it stays for more than several hundred years.
                            </p>
                            <p>Along with many normal use plastics, these single use-ones are the most harmful ones!
                                You can see some below:-
                            </p>
                            <img src="type.png" alt="Types of single use plastics"><br><hr>
                            <p>While plastic has many valuable uses, we have become addicted to single-use plastic products — with severe environmental, social, economic and health consequences.</p>
                                <p>Around the world, one million plastic bottles are purchased every minute, while up to five trillion plastic bags are used worldwide every year. In total, half of all plastic produced is designed for single-use purposes – used just once and then thrown away.</p>
                                <p>Plastics including microplastics are now ubiquitous in our natural environment. They are becoming part of the Earth's fossil record and a marker of the Anthropocene, our current geological era. They have even given their name to a new marine microbial habitat called the "plastisphere".</p>
                                <p id="ques">How did we get here?</p>
                                <p id="ans">Plastic production has sharply increased over the last 70 years. In 1950, the world produced just two million tonnes. It now produces over 450 million tonnes.<br>
                                 Plastic has added much value to our lives: it’s a cheap, versatile, and sterile material used in various applications, including construction, home appliances, medical instruments, and food packaging.<br>
                                 However, when plastic waste is mismanaged – not recycled, incinerated, or kept in sealed landfills – it becomes an environmental pollutant. One to two million tonnes of plastic enter our oceans yearly, affecting wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
